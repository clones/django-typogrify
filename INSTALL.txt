Thanks for downloading typogrify.

To install it, run the following command inside this directory::

    python setup.py install
    
Or simply move the typogrify folder into your python path.

Once ``typogrify`` is installed on your system, you can add it to the
``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting of any Django project in which you wish to
use it, and then use ``{% load typogrify %}`` in your templates to
load the filters it provides.

Note that this application requires Python 2.3 or later, and Django
0.96 or later; you can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and
Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
